Overview
========

:py:mod:`polypharm` is an open source library written in Python to
perform IFD and MM/GBSA calculations on different targets using a
polypharmacological approach.

Features
--------

It allows performing Induced Fit Docking (IFD) and binding free energy
calculations using the MM/GBSA method available in the Schr√∂dinger suite
by means of a wrapper library. The protocol performs the calculations on
different targets/proteins and considering the experimentally relevant
residues creates a scoring function to evaluate the best candidates with
activity on the different targets, i.e. it proposes the molecules with
the best polypharmacological activity.


Workflow
--------

The workflow can be divided in four main stages:

- :ref:`docking`
- :ref:`rescore`
- :ref:`report`
- :ref:`ranking`

.. _docking:

Cross docking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

    The initial structures must be previously prepared, with added
    hydrogens, correct bond orders and charges, and assignment of 
    protonation states to the desired pH. Verify that everything is 
    correct in the initial .mae and .maegz files.

.. _rescore:

Docking rescoring

.. _report:

.. _ranking:
